========================
collective.contentalerts
========================
Get alerts whenever a (two custom lists of) word is found on a content object,
be that object of any content type (Dexterity or comments).

Can be used to:

- moderate: used as a blacklist.
- highlight: used as a whitelist.

The main idea is to use the power of `plone.app.contentrules`_ to inspect content being generated by users for certain words.

Upon that, regular `plone.app.contentrules`_ actions can be triggered:
send an email, notify the user, apply a workflow transition...

The secondary idea is to be able to do different actions on the content depending on if the words where found on one or the other list.

Features
========
- manage two lists of words that will be used to search (blacklist/whitelist)

  - named ``forbidden_words`` and ``inadequate_words``

- integration with  `plone.app.contentrules`_:

  - conditions to look for stop words (either from any list or from a specific one)
  - string substitutions to add on emails the snippets where the stop words where found
    (one for documents and one for comments)

- standalone utility

  - with methods to either look for words on both lists or only on one of them

- provide different word lists if you need them,
  either two general ones (plone.registry based) or on a per contentrule basis
- look for stop words on comments and dexterity content types
- apply a marker interface to objects that are found to have stop words
- mark objects as reviewed
- monitor the list of words for changes and search for the new stop words on already reviewed objects

  - if ``[async]`` extra is enable this review will be done via an asynchronous job (via `collective.taskqueue`_)

Where it searches on
====================
collective.contentalerts searches either on the comments' text or on ``text`` (for Dexterity based content types).

Standalone usage
================
While the main integration within Plone is via a plone.app.contentrules condition,
``collective.contentalerts`` can also be used as a standalone utility.

Use the provided utility (``collective.contentalerts.interfaces.IAlert``).

Documentation
=============
Full documentation for end users can be found in the "docs" folder.

Installation
============
Install collective.contentalerts by adding it to your buildout::

   [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.contentalerts


and then running "bin/buildout"

Upgrade notes
=============

Version 3.0
-----------
This version is meant to be compatible with Plone 5.2 (still on python 2.7).

Version 2.0
-----------
This version only supports Plone 5 and Dexterity,
if you are using Archetypes or Plone 4.3.x stick with version 1.x.

So far only the migration to Plone 5 differs from the last 1.x release.

Keep an eye on `CHANGES.rst <https://github.com/collective/collective.contentalerts/blob/master/CHANGES.rst>`_.

Version 1.0 and below
---------------------
If you are upgrading from 0.7 to any later version there's one manual step that needs to be done.

On version 1.0 the single list of stop words was split into ``inadequate_words`` and ``forbidden_words``.

As it can not be guessed which list the former list is supposed to map,
no automatic migration is provided.

An `upgrade step <http://docs.plone.org/develop/addons/components/genericsetup.html#upgrade-steps>`_ needs to be written then.

See below an example on how to migrate the former list to the new ``forbidden_words`` list::

    from plone import api
    from plone.registry.interfaces import IRegistry
    from zope.component import getUtility

    # safe the stop words on the old location
    old_setting = 'collective.contentalerts.interfaces.IStopWords.stop_words'
    current_forbidden_words = api.portal.get_registry_record(name=old_setting)

    # update registry
    setup = api.portal.get_tool('portal_setup')
    setup.runImportStepFromProfile(
        'profile-collective.contentalerts:default',
        'plone.app.registry'
    )

    # set the stop words on the new field
    api.portal.set_registry_record(
        name='collective.contentalerts.interfaces.IStopWords.forbidden_words',
        value=current_forbidden_words
    )

    # remove the old setting
    registry = getUtility(IRegistry)
    del registry.records[old_setting]
